# ðŸ“Š RKY Mega Stores Excel Capstone Project

This capstone project was completed as part of a business intelligence training program. I acted as a Business Intelligence Analyst for *RKY Mega Stores*, a UK-based retailer. My role was to extract actionable insights from their historical sales and order data (2009â€“2012) 
using Excel.

## ðŸ§  Objective

Answer key business questions such as:
- Which product category had the highest sales?
- What are the top and bottom regions by revenue?
- What were appliance sales in Ontario?
- Which customers returned items and what segments do they belong to?
- Which shipping methods were cost-effective vs. overused?

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Excel
- Pivot Tables & Charts
- INDEX-MATCH & lookup functions
- Conditional formatting & data validation

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- Technology was the top-selling category.
- West and Ontario regions outperformed others.
- Express Air was used inefficiently on low-priority orders.
- High-value customers were mostly from the Corporate segment.
- Returns came mostly from the Consumer segment, signaling a need for post-sale review.

## âœ… Outcome
Each worksheet featured structured pivot tables, meaningful labels, and dynamic charts. The workbook provided RMS management with data-driven recommendations to optimize regional strategy, shipping methods, and customer retention.

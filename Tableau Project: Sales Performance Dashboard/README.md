 Tableau Project: Sales Performance Dashboard ‚Äì Nigeria

## üè¢ Client Overview
A fast-growing consumer electronics and fashion retailer operating in Nigeria, with a nationwide footprint spanning Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, and several regional cities. The business had seen rapid product expansion and wanted to optimize profitability across categories and locations while forecasting performance trends accurately.

## üéØ Business Challenge
The client faced three major issues:

- **Unclear regional and demographic performance** ‚Äì Management lacked visibility into which states, age groups, and payment methods drove profitability.
- **Margin erosion** ‚Äì Frequent discounts and inconsistent profit margins by product and salesperson were impacting bottom-line results.
- **Forecasting volatility** ‚Äì Revenue projections were unreliable, limiting the ability to plan stock, promotions, and staffing.

## üîç Analytical Approach
As a Data Analyst, I built an interactive Tableau dashboard that consolidated data across sales channels, product lines, and demographic segments to address the client's strategic concerns.

## üìå Key Findings
- **Top Performing Categories**: Phones generated the highest total revenue, but accessories delivered stronger profit margins per unit.
- **Salesperson Impact**: Remota, Feyisola, and Segun were top-performing sales reps, collectively contributing over ‚Ç¶16B in profit‚Äîhighlighting the need for incentive alignment.
- **Demographic Insights**: Female customers accounted for 56% of profits, with the 29‚Äì47 age group driving the majority of purchases‚Äîguiding future targeting.
- **Payment Preferences**: 80% of profits came from cash and POS payments, indicating the need for stronger digital payment integration.
- **Forecast Trends**: Weekly profit forecasts showed volatility, especially in Q2 2016, with a noticeable drop across all categories‚Äîsignaling potential issues in logistics or pricing.
- **Geographic Trends**: Southern states like Lagos and Rivers led in profit concentration, while underperforming northern regions flagged an opportunity for outreach or promotional adjustment.

## ‚úÖ Impact
- **Improved decision-making**: Leadership used the dashboard during monthly strategy reviews to realign sales targets and promotional campaigns.
- **Profit-focused planning**: Category managers shifted marketing spend toward high-margin accessories and streamlined low-profit clothing SKUs.
- **Better forecasting**: The sales team used visual trend forecasts to anticipate seasonal drops and plan resource allocation more effectively.
